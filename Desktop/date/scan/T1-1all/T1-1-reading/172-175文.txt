A gold ring valued at $1,200 was found during storm cleanup at Avondale
Beach on Saturday morning.This was only one of many objects retrieved from the sand over the weekend by the Kirkland Sanitation Department.In preparation for Friday's fireworks show,municipal cleaning crews combed the beach on Saturday and Sunday to remove debris washed up by Thursday night's storm.
Crew member Liam O'Donnell,who has worked every storm cleanup for the last five years,said,"You wouldn't believe some of the things we find.Last year I pulled a vacuum cleaner out of the sand.But it's really common to find things like umbrellas,jewelry,coins,and even bicycles.These are things that beachgoers often forget or lose at the beach.When there's a storm,they all come to the surface,and we find them."
.
All valuables found by city cleaning crews are taken to the Kirkland Community Center.They are kept here for up to 90 days.During that time,anyone who has lost an item can look for it at the community center.Any valuables that are not claimed are sold at the annual community auction,which benefits the city library and parks.
