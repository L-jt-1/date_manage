Hi,Roberto.I just got to my hotel from
the airport but can't find the number for
PXY Enterprises.Do you have it?I
need to confirm today's client meeting.

Also,I talked to Marcia in finance.She said she hasn't
seen the report from your last trip.

Oh,that.I'll bring it to her when I get
back tomorrow.Thanks for the reminder.

OK,see you soon!

Who is Roberto?
A coworker of Noelle's
A financial consultant
An employee of PXY Enterprises
A travel agent

At 10:49 A.M.,what does Roberto most likely
mean when he writes,"she hasn't seen the
no report from your last trip"?
Marcia has been out of the office.
The report got lost.
Marcia will finish the report.
The report is late
