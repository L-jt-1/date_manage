I wanted to let everyone know that management has decided to postpone our annual company hiking trip,which is usually held in December.As all of you know,that is the busiest time of year for our car rental agency,and every year it is difficult to fit the trip into our schedule.The new date is 23 January.This should be more convenient for anyone who wants to go.

If you would like to help plan the trip,please call Sandra Logan in Human Resources at extension 45.She needs help coordinating meals for the day.She has already confirmed that we will be hiking the Tongariro Alpine Crossing up to the Emerald Lakes.
