Congratulations on your new position and thank you for sending the invoice for the products I ordered.When I spoke with Emilia Katzenbach,my previous contact at Restaurflex,she offered a discount on item RX1800,bringing the unit cost from 30 cents to 20 cents each.I understand that your prices have increased,but The Gramerty is a longtime customer.Could you please speak to her to confirm this and then send us an updated invoice?
In addition,customers who ordered from our take-away menu have complained that the plastic lids on their containers did not close securely,and their soup leaked out.We never had this problem before our most recent order last December.I would like to return the remainder of this item,RX2028,and be reimbursed accordingly.Could you recommend a suitable replacement?
