Excuse me.My mobile phone's been very slow and sometimes loses calls,so I'm interested in a new one.
I'd be happy to help you find a new phone.Have you seen the latest smartphones we have on display?We have a few models 
at excellent prices.
Isaw those,butI read on your company Web site that you have some phones for sale at half price.
We do have several select phones available at half price.However,they're very basic phones.Smartphones like these,on the other hand,have features like Web browsing and road navigation that you wouldn't get from a basic mobile phone.Here,let me show you how they work.
