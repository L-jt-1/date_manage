Could you take these packages to the post office?
I'll be free after my conference call.
They're packaged by the dozen.
I haven't received any mail.

Why is the street closed?
Go straight ahead.
It's nearby.
Because they're doing repair work.

Is the doctor in today?
How often?
That's not a good day.
No,she's not.

What's going on in the building next door?
A reception's being held.
But I just turned it off.
I'm sure you're next.

That theater always sells out quickly,doesn't it?
I prefer comedies.
We sat in the first row.
True,so let's get our tickets now.
