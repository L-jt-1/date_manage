Hello,Amanda.Do you have a few minutes to discuss the feedback I received on the training seminar I presented to the new engineers last week?
Sure!I heard that the comments were generally ver positive.The new hires said your explanations were very clear
Yes.However,they did mention that it was a lot of information to absorb in a short time.I was thinking that the next 
time I do this,I'd give them a break halfway through the seminar.What do you think?
That's a good idea.And maybe you could also set aside a half hour at the end so you'll have more time to answer all of  the trainees'questions.
