Hi,Chef Bertrand,this is Shelley calling from the restaurant kitchen.We just got today's fresh produce delivery,and I'm a bit concerned.There are quite a few extra vegetables here that aren't on our usual order list,but I don't remember any special events being scheduled this week,and I don't see any listed on the calendar.Did you order anything special?I   was going to call the supplier,but I thought I should check with you first.So,uh,remember I need to finish the kitchen  inventory this morning ..and it's already ten o'clock.Thanks.
