Hi,I've just unloaded the last box of bathroom tiles.The whole delivery's in your warehouse now.Would you be able to 
sign for them?I need a signature.
I'm sorry;this is my first day on the job.I'd better check with the warehouse manager to see if I'm allowed to do that.
Should I wait here while you check?
Actually,if you wouldn't mind moving your truck,that'd be great,since we're expecting some other deliveries shortly.
