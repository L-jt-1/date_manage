OK,Ms.Torres,I have your price estimate.To have the whole exterior of your house painted,including the fence,will cost 
you five thousand dollars.
That's quite a bit more than we expected.And actually Colgate Painting said they would do it for four thousand dollars.
Well,the cost of paint and supplies is included in the price I quoted you,so we really offer a very good deal.
That's a bit of a relief.If there are no other charges,we'll probably be able to stay within our budget.

What are the speakers discussing?
An appliance warranty
Blueprints from a designer
A building permit
A home improvement project

Why does the woman say,"And actually Colgate Painting said they would do it for four thousand dollars"?
To clarify a request
To negotiate a price
To offer some help
To recommend a service

Why is the woman relieved? 
Some work will be completed on time.
A cost estimate includes supplies.
A selected item is in stock.
Experienced workers will be on-site.
