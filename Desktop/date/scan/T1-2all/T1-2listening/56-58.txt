Hello,Oscar-it's Tanya from the Cardona Museum.Unfortunately our budget's been cut,so we'll have to delay some of the 
renovations we've asked you to do.
Ah-that's too bad.Do you know which parts of the project you'd like to put off?
Well,I know we talked about adding a library wing on the west side of the building-but that's very expensive.So,if we 
don't make that addition,that's all we may need to cut.
You know,that's not a bad idea.Let's see how much you'd save if I take the library out of the renovation proposal.I'll 
e-mail you a revised estimate this afternoon.

What is the problem?
A deadline has been moved up.
Some funding has been reduced.
Some materials have not been delivered.
An architect is not available.

Which part of the renovations will likely be postponed?
A library addition
Some roof repairs
An electrical system upgrade
Some window replacements

He would like to hear more suggestions.
He prefers the original plan.
He agrees with the proposed solution.
He has a better idea.
