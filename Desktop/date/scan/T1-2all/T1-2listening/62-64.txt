Hi.I'm going on a trip,and I'm interested in buying an electronic reader so I don't have to carry books with me.
Well,we carry all major brands of e-readers here-I'm sure we can find the right one for you.
Oh,good.
Are you looking for any special features?
It has to be user-friendly-I'm not very good with technology.I just want to read books-not watch movies or play games.
In that case,I'd suggest this one.It's very easy to download e-books onto it,and it holds up to three hundred books.Here,let me show you how it works.
