Hi.abriella.wanted to talk to you about using the new online time reporting system...A lot of people have been asking 
about it.
Yes,well,I've been very busy.But I am planning the training session for early next week.That should make it quite clear to everyone.
OK.But isn't there any written documentation?
What do you mean?
You know,a guide that staff can follow in the meantime.I don't think that's necessary.I'll have everyone go through the steps with me in the computer lab.Then they'll know exactly what to do.It's very simple.

What are the speakers discussing?
Drafting a contract
Working extra hours
Using a new time reporting system
Revising a vacation policy

What does the man imply when he says,"A lot of people have been asking about it"?
Staff are confused about a procedure.
People have heard that a workshop is interesting.
Staff are waiting for a new assignment.
A vacation calendar has not been posted yet.

What does the woman plan to do?

Ask for assistance
Take some time off
Author a manual
