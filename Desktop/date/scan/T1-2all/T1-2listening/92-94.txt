Hi,this is Laura Dunn.I'm calling about a catering order you just delivered for our corporate luncheon this afternoon.
I just realized that one of the food trays we ordered wasn't included-we're missing the pasta.Now,between the sushi and the chicken dish,we'll have enough food,but I wanted to make sure we get a refund on the pasta.Could you please process the refund to the same credit card I used to place the order?Thanks and have a nice day.

What event does the speaker mention?
A training session
A company lunch
A cooking contest
A grand opening

What is the problem?
An item is missing.
A delivery was late.
A discount was not applied.
A staff member is unavailable.

Look at the graphic.How much money will the speaker be refunded?
