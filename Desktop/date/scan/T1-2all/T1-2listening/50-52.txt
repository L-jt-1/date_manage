Thabo and Michiko,I need help designing some pamphlets for our evening business courses.I'd like to have them ready 
before the end of April.
Sure.Should we take a look at the ones from last year or make them different?
You know,I think the pamphlets last year had too many details.People can get dates and times from the Web site.
I agree.Let's focus on the skills that people will learn in each class.
OK.I'll come up with a rough version of the text for the pamphlet by tomorrow and e-mail it to you.Then,next week we can start working on the design.

What are the speakers planning to advertise?
Evening classes
Job opportunities
An online store
A printing demonstration
