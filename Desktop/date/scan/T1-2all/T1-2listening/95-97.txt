Good morning and thanks for inviting me to this board meeting.You asked me to find ways for our company to become more environmentally friendly,so here's what I came up with.Here are four options for desktop management software.After business hours,when most computers are not in use,these programs will automatically turn off our computers,saving costs and energy.All are compatible with the hardware we use,and the projected
savings are comparable for all four software systems. However,only one has a system for backing up data in an emergency.So that's the one I recommend.

Where does the talk most likely take place?
At a press conference
At a company meeting
At a job-training session
At a technology conference

What does the company want to do?
Hire a consultant
Purchase new desktop computers
Become more environmentally friendly
Have employees work at night

Look at the graphic.Which option does the speaker
recommend?
