Hi,Jim.I hear you're going to the jazz concert on Friday.Can I ask you a favor?
Sure,what do you need?
A few of us from the graphics department are also attending the concert,but we have a meeting until six o'clock on 
Friday.Since there are no assigned seats,we were wondering if you could save a few places for us
That shouldn't be a problem.I don't have any meetings on Friday afternoon,so I plan to get there when the doors open.How many should I reserve?
Hmm...I'm not sure yet if Eduardo is joining us.Why don't I send him an e-mail right now,and I'll let you know how many seats to save.

What does the woman ask the man to do?
Record a performance
Save some seats
Check the time of a meeting
Arrange for transportation

Look at the graphic.When does the man plan to arrive at the concert hall?

What will the woman do next?
