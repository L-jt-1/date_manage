Your CM200 microwave oven can be placed easily in your kitchen,family room,oofice.Set the oven on a flat surface such as a kitchen countertop or a sturdy table.It is important to allow air to flow freely around the oven.Allow at least 10 centimeters of space around the sides,top,and back of the microwave oven.Do not install the oven in an enclosed space.Do not place it above a gas or electric range.Keep all vents clear during cooking.The reason for this is that blocked air exits will cause the oven to shut down automatically after it is turned on.

I am writing on behalf of my fellow community members to request more bicycle lanes in our town.The development of new business faciities near residential areas has shortened the distance we need to
commute.The opening of a bicycle shop on Holleyhill Avenue attests to the increase in bicycle usage.In fact,the Huxton Daily made note of this in an article earlier in the year.
I understand that the council approved plans on September 6 for bicycle lane development on Teasdale Street and Port Avenue.I fully support these measure s.Indeed, I feel that more bicycle lanes should follow.Please improve the safety and efficiency of our roads by adding bicycle lanes.
