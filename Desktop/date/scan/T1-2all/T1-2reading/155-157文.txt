We will be receiving a shipment of bricks tomorrow morning.The manufacturer has informed me that the truck
will be arriving at 7:30 A.M..When the truck arrives,please take inventory as the shipment is unloaded and verify that the quantities on the receipt are accurate.In addition,please make sure that the bricks are
stacked no more than three bricks high.They are fragile,and I am concerned that they might crack from the pressure if they are stacked in tall piles.Please also confirm the successful arrival of materials and report any problems to me by e-mail.

What is the purpose of the e-mail?
To provide instructions to an employee
To address a mistake with a shipment
To place an order for bricks
To record the inventory for a shipment

Why is Ms.Kwon concerned about the shipment?
It may arrive late.
It contains breakable material.
It was very expensive.
It is for an important client.
