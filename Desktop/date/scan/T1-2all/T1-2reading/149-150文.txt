Hi Eun Hee,do you have a minute to look at something?
Sure,what do you need?
I'll e-mail it to you.It's the draft for the cover of Anne Wahlberg's book.
One second...
Okay,got it.Let me take a look.
Is the title too difficult to read?I wanted it to be eye-catching and different.
I like the effect.But you could be right.Maybe if you changed
the color?Even just a darker shade of blue would help.
Good idea.I'll give that a try.Mind if I run it past you again later?
No problem
